# natchat
A Tamil transliteration and romanization scheme for casual microblogging and frequent Web use.

Goals:
- improve upon previous schemes including [ISO 15919](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_15919), 7-bit ISO, and [ITRANS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITRANS), while being particularly suited to Tamil phonology
- easy to type with a standard ASCII keyboard, and easy to read by an American English speaker, without sacrificing phonological accuracy
- easy to convert into written Tamil script either mentally or via computer script.

Innovations:
- all lower case for ease of reading
- usage of : following long vowels and - for nasalized vowels
- usage of . preceding retroflex consonants (like 7-bit ISO)
- retroflex approximant gains a more intuitive representation for English speakers (unlike zh, \r represents its similarities to AmEng "r")

## vowels

| tamil vowel | natchat equivalent | [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Tamil) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| அ | a | ä |
| ஆ | a: | äː |
| இ | i | i |
| ஈ | i: | iː |
| உ | u | u |
| ஊ | u: | uː |
| எ | e | e |
| ஏ | e: | eː |
| ஐ | ai | aɪ̯ |
| ஒ | o | o |
| ஓ | o: | oː |
| ஔ | au | aʊ̯ |
| (nasalization, spoken only) | - (hyphen following vowel) | nasal vowel ([ãː], [õː], etc.) |
| (shortened உ, spoken only<sup>1</sup>) | u/ | ɯ~ɨ |

1. Word final /u/ is pronounced as [ɯ], this phenomenon is called kuṟṟiyalukaram (or, in natchat, kutriyalugaram).

## consonants

| tamil consonant | natchat equivalent (with intervocalic allophones) | [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Tamil) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| க் | k (or g) | k, medial g ~ x ~ ɣ |
| ங் | ng | ŋ |
| ச் | c  | t͡ɕ ~ t͡ʃ, medial s, postnasal dʑ~dʒ |
| ஞ் | ~n | ɲ |
| ட் | .t (or .d, or t or d <sup>1</sup>) | ʈ, medial ɖ~ɽ |
| ண் | .n | ɳ |
| த் | th (or dh) | t̪ ~ θ, medial d̪ ~ ð |
| ந் | _n or n <sup>2</sup> | n̪ |
| ப் | p (or b) | p, medial b~β |
| ம் | m | m |
| ய் | y | j |
| ர் | r | ɾ |
| ல் | l | l |
| வ் | v | ʋ |
| ழ் | \r | ɻ |
| ள் | .l | ɭ |
| ற் | ^r or r <sup>2</sup> | r |
| (doubled consonant) | letter written twice | consonant+ ː|
| ற்ற | ^r^r or t^r or tr <sup>3</sup> | tːr |
| ன்ற | n^r or nd^r or ndr <sup>3</sup> | ndr |

Notes:
1. .t and .d can be alternatively written t and d since there is no equivalent alveolar sound in written Tamil, thus no possible confusion in a Tamil context. However, to preserve retroflex representation for AmEng speakers, since they are unique from AmEng "t" and "d", they are written here with a period preceding.
2. If it is unnecessary to distinguish ன் from ந், both can be written as n. Similarly, if it is unnecessary to distinguish ர் from ற், both can be written as r.
3. For ease of representing the phonetic change caused by Tamil grammar for digraphs ற்ற and ன்ற, a t or d may be placed in between the two consonants, respectively. Each ற் may be represented by ^r or r, as in (2)

Loaned Grantha letters:
| grantha consonant | natchat equivalent | [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Tamil) |
| --- | --- |
| ஜ | j | dʑ |
| ஶ் | `s | ɕ |
| ஷ் | sh | ʂ |
| ஸ் | s | s |
| ஹ் | h | h |
|  | ksh |  |

## general notes
Differences from IPA:
- natchat vowels are broadly similar to IPA, apart from ä being simplified to a.
